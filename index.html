      <h6>When I’m coding, I lose all track of time!</h6>
      <h6>There’s something magical about taking a few lines of code and creating something from nothing. The momentary high you get when everything works, and challenge felt when things don’t!</h6>
      <h6>When I first learned how to code, I was told to treasure the small victories. That was good advice given that learning to code can be an exercise in frustration. While that advice served me well, my favorite, all-time advice must be: “If the problem you’re trying to solve is too hard, you need to break it into smaller pieces”. This advice gives me the power to solve the biggest of problems! Now when I look at a problem instead of seeing one big immovable object, I see a big object made up of individual tasks that are manageable and easily completed.</h6>
      <h6>Coding is both an individual and collaborative line of work. I enjoy working on my own but also enjoy working and communicating with my team. Everyone has their own way of coding and it’s from working with other coders that we can continue to hone and perfect our techniques.</h6>
      <h6>It must have been a coder that said, if you love what you do, you’ll never work a day in your life.</h6>
